#### About this app:
#### 1. You will be given a random number at the start of the game.
#### 2. There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
#### 3. You win the game by matching your total score to random number, you loose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
#### 4. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
#### 5. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.

#### Got bored and decided to revamp this. Used Materialize CSS Framework for quick build up. May come back to finish this up. I kept the original version's files and took a screen shot of it below. I still remember the night LOL. It wasn't the prettiest and didn't even work LOL. It has sentimental value to me though.

#### User can select the button at the bottom of the screen to view the rules of the game. This keeps the app clean and free of clutter. They hit start if they are ready to play.

#### The start and instruction buttons will disappear and make way for the game display.
